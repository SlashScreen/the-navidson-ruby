# the-navidson-ruby
Wraps all instances of the word "house" in an HTML document (outside of tags and links, hopefully) in a span of the class "house", allowing you to highlight it like the book *House of Leaves*.

## Usage:
`ruby house.rb {directory}` to house-ize everything in a directory. It has no external dependencies.  

## Why did I make this?
I did it for a dumb gag on my website. I put it here on github in case anyone else wants it, for whatever reason.

The highlight color on the cover is `#7998ec`.
